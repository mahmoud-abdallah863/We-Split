# We-Split

Following 100DayOfSwift challenge in [Hacking with swift](hackingwithswift.com/)

This is my first SwiftUI project in this challenge. So no crazy stuff is happening here  :smile:

<br>

### App idea
Calculating amount to pay per person for a paycheck with tip percent
<br><br>
So basically you enter the check amount, the number of people and the tip percent. And the app will tell you how much each person should pay,
and how much is for you tip.

### What i used:
  * Swift UI :rocket:
  * 2 way data binding
  * Text
  * Sections
  * Pickers
  * Ligh/Dark mode support
